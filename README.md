# React Components Documentation

This project contains several React components that demonstrate various React concepts and features. Below is a detailed explanation of each component.

## Counter Component (`Counter.tsx`)

The Counter component is an interactive counter that demonstrates state management, event handling, and useEffect hooks.

### Features:
- Increment and decrement functionality
- Customizable step size (1, 2, 5, 10, 20)
- Auto-increment feature with start/stop control
- Reset functionality
- Responsive button layout

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
1. **State Management**
   - Uses `useState` for managing count, step size, and auto-increment state
   - Example: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`

2. **Event Handling**
   - Button click handlers for increment, decrement, reset, and auto-increment
   - Step size selection

3. **useEffect Hook**
   - Implements auto-increment functionality using `setInterval`
   - Proper cleanup of intervals to prevent memory leaks

4. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Different button styles based on auto-increment state
   - Active step size indication

## StudentInfo Component (`StudentInfo.tsx`)

The StudentInfo component is a form component that handles student information input with validation.

### Features:
- Form input for student details (name, age, course)
- Date of birth selection (year, month, date)
- Form validation with error messages
- Edit mode for submitted information
- Course selection from predefined options

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
1. **Form Handling**
   - Controlled form inputs
   - Form submission handling
   - Input validation

2. **TypeScript Types**
   - Custom type definitions for validation rules
   - Type safety for form data

3. **State Management**
   - Form data state
   - Error state
   - Edit mode state

4. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Form focus management
   - Smooth scrolling to form

## WelcomeCard Component (`WelcomeCard.tsx`)

The WelcomeCard component is a dynamic welcome message component with interactive features.

### Features:
- Dynamic greeting based on time of day
- Editable name with double-click functionality
- Color-coded greeting options
- Interactive greeting selection

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
1. **Props and State**
   - Props for name and name change handler
   - State for greeting and edit mode

2. **Event Handling**
   - Double-click to edit
   - Click to change greeting
   - Keyboard events for form submission

3. **useEffect Hook**
   - DOM focus management
   - Time-based greeting calculation

4. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Edit mode toggle
   - Greeting display

## Main Page (`page.tsx`)

The main page component that brings all components together in a responsive layout.

### Features:
- Responsive grid layout
- Component organization
- Navigation link
- Footer section

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
1. **Component Composition**
   - Integration of multiple components
   - Layout structure

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Grid layout with responsive breakpoints
   - Mobile-friendly design

3. **Styling**
   - Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Consistent theme across components

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses React's built-in `useState` hook for local state management
- State updates are handled through setter functions
- State is properly initialized with appropriate default values

### Event Handling
- Click events for buttons and interactive elements
- Form events for input handling
- Keyboard events for accessibility
- Event handlers are properly typed with TypeScript

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent color scheme across components
- Responsive design patterns
- Interactive states (hover, focus, active)

### TypeScript Integration
- Proper type definitions for props and state
- Type safety for event handlers
- Interface definitions for component props
- Type checking for form validation

### Best Practices
- Component separation of concerns
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Accessible form controls
- Responsive design patterns
- Error handling and validation
- Clean and maintainable code structure
